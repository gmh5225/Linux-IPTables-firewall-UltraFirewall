# Tool purpose
This is a purely deffensive tool to protect your device against DoS/DDoS and network attacks that may harm your device. It has been built using IPTables rules and kernel configuration, you can use either the shell or the kernel config separately as they don't depend on each other.

# Warning
This tool is still on development so some configurations can harm your networking or system, please before using it on a main device/server test it at a VM or another secondary device, in case the shell script block your network just restart the system, if the kernel configuration gives you any problem please reset your device to factory mode. Always have a backup of your data.
